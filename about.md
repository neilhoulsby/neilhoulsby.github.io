I am a Senior Staff Research Scientist and manager in the Google Deepmind (previously, Google Brain), in Zürich. 
I work in machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a focus on vision-language models (VLMs), scalable pre-training, sparsity, modularity, and task adaptation.

Prior to Google, I received my PhD from the Cambridge Computational and Biological Learning lab, supervised by Zoubin Ghahramani and Máté Lengyel. My areas of study were Bayesian ML, active learning, and cognitive science.
