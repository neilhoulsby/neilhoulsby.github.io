I am a Senior Staff Research Scientist in the Google Deepmind (formerly, Google Brain), based in Zürich. 
I work in machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a focus on vision-language models, scalability, computer vision, pre-training, and transfer learning.

Prior to Google, I received my PhD from the Cambridge Computational and Biological Learning lab, supervised by Zoubin Ghahramani and Máté Lengyel. My areas of study were Bayesian ML, active learning, and cognitive science.

I am a hiring manager in Google Deepmind EMEA, if you have a strong background in machine learning and/or computer vision, feel free to reach out.
