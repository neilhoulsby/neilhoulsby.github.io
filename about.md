I am a Member Of Technical Staff at Anthropic, and lead of our new Zurich site.
We work on the research and development of safe and aligned frontier language models, with a focus on multimodal capabilities.

Previously, I was a Senior Staff Research Scientist and manager at Google Deepmind and Google Brain, where I led a team working on neural architectures, vision, and language models.
I have been fortunate to work on many interesting topics, including Transformers [[ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)] and other neural architectures [[Mixer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01601)], parameter-efficient finetuning [[Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00751)], scaling [[VIT-22b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05442), [V-MoE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05974)], and vision-language models [[Gemini](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11805), PaLI [A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06794), [B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18565), [C](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07726)].

I received my PhD from the Cambridge Computational and Biological Learning lab, supervised by Prof. Zoubin Ghahramani and Prof. Máté Lengyel, where I studied statistical machine learning and cognitive science.
