An approach is described, based on Bayesian statistical methods, that allows the fitting of a design profile to a set of measurements of undrained strengths. In particular allowance is made for the automatic determination of not only the positions of boundaries between geological units, but also the selection of the number of units to model the data in an appropriate way.
