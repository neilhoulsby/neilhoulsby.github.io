Entity linking involves labeling phrases in text with their
referent entities, such as Wikipedia or Freebase entries. This task is challenging due to the large number of possible entities, in the millions, and
heavy-tailed mention ambiguity. We formulate the problem in terms of
probabilistic inference within a topic model, where each topic is associated with a Wikipedia article. To deal with the large number of topics
we propose a novel efficient Gibbs sampling scheme which can also incorporate side information, such as the Wikipedia graph. This conceptually
simple probabilistic approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
entity-linking on the Aida-CoNLL dataset.
