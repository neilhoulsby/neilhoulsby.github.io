We propose a method to learn image representations from uncurated videos. We combine a supervised loss from off-the-shelf object detectors and self-supervised losses which naturally arise from the video-shot-frame-object hierarchy present in each video. We report competitive results on 19 transfer learning tasks of the Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark (VTAB), and on 8 out-of-distribution-generalization tasks, and discuss the benefits and shortcomings of the proposed approach. In particular, it improves over the baseline on all 18/19 few-shot learning tasks and 8/8 out-of-distribution generalization tasks. Finally, we perform several ablation studies and analyze the impact of the pretrained object detector on the performance across this suite of tasks.
