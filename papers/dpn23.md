We propose Dual PatchNorm: two Layer Normalization layers (LayerNorms), before and after the patch embedding layer in Vision Transformers. We demonstrate that Dual PatchNorm outperforms the result of exhaustive search for alternative LayerNorm placement strategies in the Transformer block itself. In our experiments, incorporating this trivial modification, often leads to improved accuracy over well-tuned Vision Transformers and never hurts.
